#tzion

##What is tzion?

tzion is an api to automate policies creation into Palo Alto firewalls. With tzion you don't need to create policies manually through palo alto webpage. Instead of it, you can use the tzion to interact with the Palo Alto API to create L7 policies using customized applications inside the destination application field. You also can use the tzion to create L4 policies.

> now the api is only supporting web-browsing and ssl applications
